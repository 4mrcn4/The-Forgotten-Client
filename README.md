The Forgotten Client
===============

The Forgotten Client is a free and open-source game client written completely in C++. It is supposed to be used to connect to The Forgotten Server.  
This project is created using:
* [libSDL 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/)
* [libCURL](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
* [LZMA-SDK](https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html)

### Issues

Since this project is at early stage of work there are a lot of things that aren't supported yet, it shouldn't be treated as already working product so don't expect much of it at this point. If you want to use something that is already working, you should use [OTClient](https://github.com/edubart/otclient) instead.
